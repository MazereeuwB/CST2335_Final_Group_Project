# CST2335_Final_Group_Project
Each group member completed a branch, which were then merged into one application.
My part is under NASA_Imagery.  The purpose is to allow the user to enter latitude, longitude, and direction details into the application, 
which will return a satellite image of that location.  The user can then save that image to a favourites list if they like, which is also
accessible.
